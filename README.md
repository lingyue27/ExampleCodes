## Matlab

- Matlab_EyetrackingExp
- Testing codes for eyetracking study

> _It's important to mention that this set of code originates from my collaborator, Dr. Lukasz Grzeczkowski, who played a significant role in guiding me through eyetracking research using Matlab. We collaborated on multiple eyetracking experiments. Initially, he handled the testing codes for our early experiments, and I gradually learned and took over the coding task for the later experiments. The provided sample code is from a training session in one of our later experiments, which I coded myself. Currently, the paper from this study is under revision of the British Journal of Psychology._ 

## Python

- Python_TactileExp
- Testing codes for sensorimotor study

> _This set of code is entirely written independently by me in Python, which may exhibit some variations in personal style when compared to the above mentioned Matlab code._ 

## R

- R_DataAnalysis
- Data analysis code

> _This code utilizes the R package Quickpsy for fitting psychometric functions. While I initially worked with the Palamedes Toolbox in Matlab for similar analyses, I gradually transitioned to using R to take advantage of its compatibility with ggplot._
